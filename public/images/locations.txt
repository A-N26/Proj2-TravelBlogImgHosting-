- Thailand -

I was searching among my international tour photos folder and quite a few fond memories got vaguely freshened up. I had visited Thailand and Malaysia in 2008, more fonder time. From the get-go i was very excited but at that point it was more so a childish excitement. It was the 1st time i had learnt a new word in a language unknown to me and it was through the very cheerful flight-crew that were greeting all passengers coming onboard by joining their palms in a very india style preying stance and saying either "sawadika" (for females) or "sawadikrap" (for males).

    - While the hotel stay was pleasant, we had decided upon not limiting our experience by booking a bus tour and instead exploring (but certainly within limits so as to not find any sort of troubles). Luckily we had managed to find locals around us who were very accommodating, well-meaning and very helpful. Then be it the hotel staff, the Rikshaw driver, taxi driver or other locals.

    - Among our first few landmarks to visit was a Vishnu temple which was highly crowded. Apparently it is said to be the oldest built temple in Bangkok. the statutes of various gods were rather big. But that was not a very new sight (but a unique one nonetheless). What was unique and interesting was seeing a group preying: public/images/locations/vishnu_temple_locals_preying.JPG

    - We had also visited their famous floating market and were astounded and amazed to see how crowded and lively it was. - public/images/locations/floating_market.JPG

    - I do have a photo from Thailand's very famous Phuket Province but like almost every thing in that place even their roundabouts were (and probably still are) very risk-ey. But I loved being there despite the exposure to a lot of adult products in every store kept openly. night prostitution market being the most important to the place and the people. Love it mostly coz of the beaches and the beauty of the place but also coz of the interactions with the locals there who were amazingly helpful and friendly.

    -Recalling all this for the sake of this bog post has made me very very wanting to visit thailand again and experience it all over again. And I hope to some day.


- Malaysia -

Right after Thailand we continued out tour by traveling to Malaysia. Oddly we had decided to travel to Malaysia via road (i.e, taxi) and in hindsight that was the best decision we had made PERIOD. Again, Luckily we had found a very cheerful and honest driver too.

    - Sadly apart from a bus travel from one location to another (a very foggy memory-shard!?) and a clearer memory of teh famous twin towers i cant recall much of the place (nor could i find a lot of photos of the visit!. This certainly is saddening and I hope to rectify it by revisiting Malaysia someday too)

        - view from all the way down from atop the twin towers, some 1000+ feet high (where there were the small commercial telescopes for tourists). - public/images/locations/from_top_of_TwinTower.JPG

- Oman -

This is the place I still fondly remember as the best place I ever lived in, and probably will remember it till the end of my days. Not simply because i spend a majority of my childhood ages in Oman but coz of a laundry list of variety of different reasons- I couldn't even begin to think where to start and where to stop. Initially we lived in a very small village sized city called Shinas. Then we moved to Sohar, which had become the commercial harbour city capital of Oman by the time i was teary-eyed leaving Oman for good almost 15 or so years back. Muscat is it's capital. It was a proper joy to travel to Muscat every few weeks through the long unwinding, unlit, starry skied nights or even the dry, hot, desert mornings.

    - Alas, it is with great sadness and heartache that I can't find any sharable photos of the best place and days of my life. But I for one do not need photos to truly remind me of my years in Oman as I will for ever cherish the life i had there.

- India -

I have visited India more time than i have anywhere else but that is mostly because it is my homeland. Ya never truly leave your homeland no matter how far you are. Most recently i had visited India this year and that too after almost 5/6 years of not being to India. Suffice to say loved every bit of the visit as an Indian but the visit was not without it's many issues from the perspective of an outsider/NRI. I was mostly there reconnecting with my family and friends after so many years. But did evn up having a few tour-esk visits to locations i hadn't be to b4/ in a loong time.

    - One of these places being Nathdwara in Rajusthan. It is a religious location where people come from all over india as did we. But i was amazed to see and learn of a new statue of god Shiva that was built there. Apparently, it is THE 5th tallest statue in the world. and looks just as grand no matter you see it from afar or up close:  public/images/locations/20220310_084433.jpg
