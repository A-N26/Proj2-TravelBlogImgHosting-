        content: `I went to Melbourne last Christmas and I was amazed by the culture, food, and landscape of the city. It was the first time for me to spend my Christmas in summer and it was kinda weird without layers of jackets and inches of snow, but still a good one xd! Got some seafood and the oyster there was sooo fresh and delicious! The landscape of the great ocean road was stunning and I couldnâ€™t wait to jump into the blue water. Oh and we also did some snorkelling! First time for me to explore the underwater world and it was fun interacting with the wild creatures!

        content: `Just came back from Singapore and miss the Hainanese chicken rice and bak kut the so so much! it was a tiny city like Hong Kong and the climate there wasâ€¦ hot and too hotâ€¦ just like Hong KongðŸ¥µ(cant live without a/c). 
        Oh forgot to mention the Merlion! It was so aesthetic at night and walking along the harbour sidewalk was so relaxing. We also spent some time on the universal studio, it was good but no surprise. Just the same as the one in Japan and the restaurants inside wereâ€¦ super expensive lol`,

        content: `Went back to my lovely home last month, itâ€™s been a year away from my family and I miss them so so much. I also miss the tram in Hong Kong, it carries a lot of memory coz I ve been taking them to the university for 4 years xd. 
        The food is a must-try item in Hong Kong and itâ€™s much cheaper than Toronto with the same quality. Remember to try the Japanese cuisine coz itâ€™s much better than those in Toronto xd. One more thing, try NOT to drive in Hong Kong! Itâ€™s too crowded and the parking fee is tooooo HIGHâ˜¹`,
